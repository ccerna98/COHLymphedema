This is a public repository for learning about coding &amp; front-end/back-end development for the City of Hope Clinic. Currently, we have the ability to visualize sensor data from the MPU6050 6-dof IMU. The following are instructions on how to use the code:

1) First, install [Processing Version 2.2.1]("https://processing.org/download/"). I recommend version 2.2.1 as we haven't tested for other versions. 

2) You're going to want to open the .pde file (called TeaPot) in Processing - in order to visualize the data.
