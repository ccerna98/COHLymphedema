   The BLE Peripheral is typically the board you are programming. It connects the BLE central to
   expose its characteristics. In our case, the iPhone is the BLE central, which is the device that
   asks the BLE peripheral its data. That's why we won't be using a BLECentral constructor.

   Characteristics contain at least two attributes: (1) characteristic declaration, which has metadata
   about the data, and (2) the characteristic value, which contains the data itself.

   Characteristics have names, UUIDs, values, and read/write/notify properties. There are many types
   of characteristics constructors depending on the data type wanting to be used.

   The purpose of this code is to create a Bluetooth (BLE) Server, which does the following steps:
   (1) Create a BLE Server
   (2) Create a BLE Service
   (3) Create a BLE Characteristic based on this service
   (4) Create a BLE Descriptor based on the characteristic
   (5) Start the service and then start advertising

   In other words, a GATT server creates a service, which can contain multiple characteristics that
   include metadata, which in our case will be the data from the IMU (Quaternion or otherwise).

   A Quaternion is a four-element vector used to encode any rotation in a 3D coordinate system.
